  Daily water column temperature predictions for thousands of Midwest U.S. lakes between 1979-2022 and under future climate scenarios

abstract: >-
  <p>Lake temperature is an important environmental metric for understanding habitat suitability for many 
  freshwater species and is especially useful when temperatures are predicted throughout the water 
  column (known as temperature profiles). In this data release, multiple modeling approaches were used
  to generate predictions of daily temperature profiles for thousands of lakes in the Midwest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Predictions were generated using two modeling frameworks: a machine learning model 
  (specifically an entity-aware long short-term memory or EA-LSTM model; Kratzert et al., 2019) and a 
  process-based model (specifically the General Lake Model or GLM; Hipsey et al., 2019). Both the EA-LSTM and 
  GLM frameworks were used to generate lake temperature predictions in the contemporary period (1979-04-12 to 
  2022-04-11 for EA-LSTM and 1980-01-01 to 2021-12-31 for GLM; times differ due to modeling spin-up/spin-down 
  configurations) using the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS; Mitchell et al., 2004) as meteorological 
  drivers. In addition, GLM was used to generate lake temperature predictions under future climate scenarios 
  (covering 1981-2000, 2040-2059, and 2080-2099) using six dynamically downscaled Global Climate Models 
  (GCM; Notaro et al., 2018) as meteorological drivers. The modeling frameworks and driver datasets have 
  slightly different footprints and input data requirements. This means that some of the lakes do not meet 
  the criteria to be included in all three modeling approaches, which results in different numbers of lakes 
  in the output (noted in the file descriptions below).

        methods to determine daily windspeed (cubed root of the mean of cubed windspeeds). As windspeed
        is an important factor in lake temperature modeling due to its impact on mixing, the GCM windspeeds 
        between 1980-1999 were statistically transformed, such that they aligned with the distribution of 
        windspeed from NLDAS. The same statistical transform was applied to the GCM windspeeds for future dates.

    data-name: lake_temp_preds_{MODEL}_{DRIVERS}_{STATE SUBSET OR GCM TYPE}.zip
    data-description: >-
      This data release includes 9 zip files of lake temperature predictions. Each zip file contains NetCDF
      files of the lake temperature predictions, one NetCDF file per state. All the NetCDF files are organized
      following DSG standards set in the R package, `ncdfgeom` (Blodgett, 2019).
     
      Each zip contains NetCDF files with predictions for the same model-driver combination, and further subsets of
      the 3 main combinations (EALSTM-NLDAS, GLM-NLDAS, GLM-GCM) were made in order to keep each zip file under 10 GB.
      The `{MODEL}` field noted in the filename pattern above will be either "EALSTM" for the Entity-Aware Long
      Short-Term Memory model or "GLM" for the General Lake Model. The `{DRIVERS}` field in the filename will
      be either "NLDAS" for the North American Land Data Assimilation System drivers covering the contemporary
      period or "GCM" for the Global Climate Models which includes meteorological data under future climate scenarios.
     
      The {STATE SUBSET OR GCM TYPE} field (if present) further groups the NetCDFs in order for the zip files to
      remain under 10 GB. The "EALSTM_NLDAS" predictions were grouped into subsets alphabetically by state: the
      "AR-MN" file contains NetCDFs for AR, IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MI, and MN, while the "MO-WY" file contains
      NetCDFs for MO, MS, MT, ND, NE, OH, OK, SD, TN, TX, WI, and WY. The "GLM_NLDAS" predictions fit into a
      single zip file with NetCDFs for 11 states: AR, IA, IL, IN, MI, MN, MO, ND, OH, SD, and WI. Lastly, the
      "GLM_GCM" predictions had to be grouped into separate CSVs based on the 6 different climate models used
      (ACCESS, CNRM, GFDL, IPSL, MIROC5, and MRI), each of those zips contains one NetCDF per state (same 11
      states as "GLM_NLDAS").

      A csv file containing annual summaries of over 170 thermal metrics based on modeled temperatures. The field 
      {DRIVER} in the filepath pattern above is either "NLDAS" for annual summaries of the daily model predictions 
      made with GLM using the North American Land Data Assimilation System (Mitchell et al., 2004) as the meteorological 
      drivers or "GCM" for those made with GLM using six dynamically downscaled Global Climate Models (Notaro et 
      al., 2018) as the meteorological drivers. These metrics are not available for the EA-LSTM predictions.

  This research was funded by the Midwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (MW CASC) and the USGS project on 
  Predictive Understanding of Multiscale Processes, an element of the Integrated Water Prediction Program (PUMP), 
  supported by the Water Availability and Use Science Program to advance multi-scale, integrated modeling 
  capabilities to address water resource issues. This research used resources of the Core Science Analytics 
  and Synthesis Advanced Research Computing program at the U.S. Geological Survey.

process-description: >-
  This dataset was generated using two modeling frameworks: 1) a lake hydrodynamic model that uses inputs of lake-specific properties and local 
  meteorology to estimate water temperature, and 2)  an entity-aware long short-term memory network trained using lake temperature observations 
  and four lake-specific properties. Lake-specific properties and temperature observations were 
  aggregated from a variety of sources and cooperators for lakes across the US Midwest. Meteorological inputs for the contemporary period (1979-
  2022) used by both modeling frameworks were downloaded from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS, Mitchell et al., 2004). Differences
  in model spin-up and spin-down periods between the two modeling frameworks result in different prediction dates for the contemporary period. Meteorological inputs for 
  future climate scenarios used only by the hydrodynamic model were downloaded from the USGS Geo Data Portal (Blodgett et al., 2011) using the R package 
  "geoknife" (Read et al., 2015). The data downloaded was a debiased version of the dataset "Dynamical Downscaling for the Midwest and Great Lakes Basin" (Notaro et al., 2018). 
  This input data covers three different time periods (1981-2000, 2040-2059, and 2080-2099) and is referred to as "GCM" throughout this data release. 
  
  The GCM windspeeds were abnormally low compared to the NLDAS windspeed for the same date and location. As windspeed is an important factor in 
  lake temperature modeling due to its impact on mixing, the GCM windspeeds between 1980-1999 were statistically transformed, such that they 
  aligned with the distribution of windspeed from NLDAS. The same statistical transform was applied to the GCM windspeeds for future dates. 

  In this data release, lakes were discretized into a series of depth intervals for modeling input/output. The top 10 meters of the lake were discretized 
  into 0.5 m intervals. From 10 to 20 m, 1 m intervals were used. From 20 to 40 m, 2 m intervals were used. From 40 to 80 m, 5 m intervals were used.
  
  Our chosen hydrodynamic model is the open source, General Lake Model (GLM) version 3.2.0a8 (Hipsey et al, 2019). GLM is a one-dimensional dynamical model which simplifies 
  lakes using a vertical approximation, where horizontal variability is ignored. GLM uses a Lagrangian approach to layer structure where layers can 
  split and combine based on changing vertical gradients. GLM is a modern implementation of other one-dimensional models. We used GLM to run individual 
  lake simulations according to the processes described in Winslow et al. 2017 for both the contemporary period (using NLDAS as the meteorological
  inputs) and future climate scenarios (using GCM as the meteorological inputs). Outputs for water temperature were extracted at various depths (interval pattern 
  described above) and written or summarized to the files included in this set of data. In addition, a set of 172 annual metrics summarizing different thermal properties
  of interest were derived from the daily temperature outputs for each lake.
  
  Lake temperature estimates were generated using an Entity-Aware Long Short-Term Memory network (EA-LSTM), as described by Kratzert et al., 2019.
  Temperature profiles were predicted for 62966 lakes in the North American continent from 1979 to 2022. The EA-LSTM network used daily
  temperature observations from 7556 lakes. Inputs to the model were seven meteorological drivers derived from NLDAS (Mitchell et al., 2004) for the time period 1979-2022,
  and four static lake attributes: latitude, longitude, surface area, and lake elevation above sea level. The data aggregation methods used to 
  assemble the temperature profile data and the lake attributes are described in Willard et al. 2022. This data release used these methods to
  aggregate additional cooperator data. This data release also used full temperature profiles for each sampling date rather than only using surface
  temperatures.
  
  To train the EA-LSTM, temperature observations were organized into 400-day sequences. Successive sequences overlapped by 200 days. The mean
  squared error of the temperature predictions was used as a loss function. Predictions made during the first 100 days were not included in the loss
  function to allow time for the LSTM cell state to accurately represent the thermal state of the lake. Sixty percent of the available observational
  data were used to train the EA-LSTM, twenty percent were used for validation during training and hyperparameter selection, and twenty percent were
  used to evaluate the final model's performance. Data were split by lake to avoid data leakage.
  
  Lakes were discretized using the same pattern described above (smaller intervals at shallow depths getting larger at deeper depths). Observations were binned based on the
  discretized depth interval into which the depth of the observation fell. The EA-LSTM was trained to predict one temperature per depth interval at
  each time step. To allow temperature predictions at multiple depths, the number of outputs of the final fully connected layer was changed to equal
  the number of depth intervals.
  
  The hidden layer size was 256. No dropout was used. The Adam optimizer (Kingma et al., 2015) was used with a learning
  rate of 0.005. Early stopping was used to determine the optimal number of training epochs with a stopping patience of 50 epochs.
  
  Modeling environment information for both modeling frameworks are captured below.
  
  The GLM data were generated using the USGS Tallgrass Supercomputer (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9XE7ROJ) and open source tools available in the R programming 
  language (R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)). R packages loaded into this environment: zip, version: 2.2.0; glmtools, version: 0.16.0; rLakeAnalyzer,
